\begin{abstract}
  This report is mainly about basic algorithms for machine learning,
  including supervised classification, supervised regression, and unsupervised clustering.
  The mainly algorithms are decision tree, k-nearest negihbor, support vector machine, nerual network,
  linear-regression, k-means, hierarchial, and convolution nerual network.
  Most of these algorithms will be instanced with Haskell, and most of them are applied to NAO robot.
